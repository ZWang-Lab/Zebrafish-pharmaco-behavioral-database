{# The .container class provides a responsive fixed width container
The .container-fluid class provides a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport
Bootstrap's grid system allows up to 12 columns across the page
If you do not want to use all 12 columns individually, you can group the columns together to create wider columns

                <h3>Zebrafish pharmaco-behavioral database</h3>
                <p>This resource is a database generated by the Hoffman and Wang labs at Yale that catalogs the effect of <strong>774 U.S. FDA-approved drugs</strong> on basic behaviors in wild-type zebrafish. This website provides an <strong>interactive pharmaco-behavioral profiling platform</strong> for researchers to access a unique behavioral “fingerprint” for each drug that describes its effects on 24 behavioral parameters. Using automated quantitative behavioral profiling assays of larval zebrafish sleep-wake behavior (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4332-06.2006">Prober, Rihel et al. 2006</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1183090">Rihel, Prober et al. 2010</a>) and visual-startle responses to lights-OFF and lights-ON stimuli (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/dvdy.24398">Scott, Marsden et al. 2016</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2023.112243">Weinschutz Mendes, Neelakantan et al. 2023</a>), we determined the effect of each drug on <strong>12 sleep-wake</strong> and <strong>12 visual-startle</strong> parameters. The database is searchable by drug names, FDA-approved indications, and molecular targets, and can be used to access behavioral outputs and <strong>visualize quantitative behavioral profiles</strong> for each drug generated by linear mixed modeling using hierarchical clustering. The website is intended for researchers who are interested in investigating the behavioral effects of drugs with a broad range of indications in larval zebrafish and has potential applications for translational pharmacological screens.</p>
